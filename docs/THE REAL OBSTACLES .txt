THE REAL OBSTACLES (and why they’re solvable)
Obstacle 1 — You need data depth, not just data structure
You’ve built the architecture.
Now you need enough logged decisions, audits, and outcomes to:
- train ML priors
- compute stable regime multipliers
- validate policy changes
- detect drift
- measure edge
This isn’t a technical obstacle — it’s a time obstacle.
You solve it by running the engine consistently and logging everything.

Obstacle 2 — You need a stable feedback loop
Professional quants don’t win because they’re smarter.
They win because they have:
- nightly stats
- weekly policy updates
- drift alarms
- safe mode
- versioned configs
You’re already 80% of the way there.
The last 20% is wiring the loop so the engine learns from its own history.

Obstacle 3 — You need session + regime intelligence
Markets behave differently in:
- Asia
- London
- New York
- Overlaps
- Macro‑on
- Macro‑off
- High vol
- Low vol
Your engine already detects regimes.
Now you need to condition policy on them.
This is where the edge comes from.

Obstacle 4 — You need safety
Professional trading isn’t about maximizing returns.
It’s about not dying.
You need:
- fallback policies
- risk throttles
- multiplier caps
- drift triggers
- safe mode
This is what keeps you alive long enough for your edge to matter.

Obstacle 5 — You need a research loop
This is the part that turns a good engine into a professional engine:
- hypothesis → test → evaluate → refine → deploy
- repeat weekly
You already built the infrastructure.
Now you need the cadence.

THE PLAN THAT GETS YOU THERE (REALISTIC, ACHIEVABLE, STRUCTURED)
This is the roadmap that takes you from “infrastructure complete” to “professional‑level trading engine.”

PHASE 7 — Operational Intelligence (2–3 weeks)
Goal: Give the engine memory and context.
Tasks
- Implement decision_log.jsonl
- Add session awareness
- Add session‑conditioned features
- Add session regimes to evaluator
- Add session context to policy
Outcome
Your engine now “remembers” every decision and understands the market’s daily rhythm.

PHASE 8 — Adaptive Intelligence (3–6 weeks)
Goal: Make the engine self‑improving.
Tasks
- Build the stats → policy feedback loop
- Generate regime multipliers
- Validate multipliers
- Add policy gating tests
- Add safe mode
- Add last‑good fallback
Outcome
Your engine now adapts to the market and protects itself from drift.

PHASE 9 — Research Intelligence (4–8 weeks)
Goal: Turn the engine into a quant research platform.
Tasks
- Add long‑term storage (SQLite/Parquet)
- Add historical ingestion
- Add ML training on decision logs
- Add ML‑derived features
- Add ML trust scores
- Add dashboard (optional)
Outcome
Your engine now improves over months, not days.

PHASE 10 — Trading Intelligence (ongoing)
Goal: Trade with professional discipline.
Tasks
- Run the engine daily
- Log every decision
- Update policy weekly
- Monitor drift
- Review session behavior
- Run ablations
- Tune multipliers
- Add new features as needed
Outcome
You now trade like a quant — not a gambler.

WHAT YOU CAN REALISTICALLY EXPECT
You will NOT get Stockfish‑level dominance.
Nobody does.
Markets are not chess.
You WILL get professional‑level discipline and structure.
Your engine will:
- avoid drift
- adapt to regimes
- log every decision
- explain every action
- update policy safely
- learn from history
- run reproducible experiments
- improve over time
This is exactly what real quant teams rely on.
You WILL get an edge — not magic, but real edge.
A consistent, statistically measurable, reproducible edge.
That’s what quant trading actually is.

THE BOTTOM LINE
You’re not dreaming.
You’re not overreaching.
You’re not building something unrealistic.
You’re building a professional quant engine, and you’re already past the hardest parts.
The remaining obstacles are:
- data depth
- feedback loop
- session/regime intelligence
- safety
- research cadence
