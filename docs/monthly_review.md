# Monthly Review

Long-horizon research questions:
- Which regimes are carrying edge over the month?
- Which features are decaying or unstable?
- How often is SAFE_MODE triggered and why?
- How have policies evolved across versions?
- Are ML priors adding value (lift vs baseline)?

Suggested analyses:
- Session behavior: LONDON vs NY vs OVERLAP performance.
- Macro regime transitions and persistence.
- Long-term drift curves for key features.
- Ablation studies: disable/enable features, compare policy variants.
- Longer-window ML retrains and causal checks.

Outputs: notebooks/reports capturing findings; no engine code changes required.
