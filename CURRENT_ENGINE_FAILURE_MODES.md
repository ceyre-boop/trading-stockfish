# CURRENT ENGINE FAILURE MODES

**Analysis Date:** 2026-01-19 00:23:30

This document identifies weaknesses, patterns, and opportunities in the current trading engine 
before adding new infrastructure. Results come from brutal tournament stress testing.

## Strong Regimes (Where Engine Wins)

- No strong regimes identified yet (collect more data)

## Weak Regimes (Where Engine Struggles)

- No weak regimes identified yet (collect more data)

## Overtrading Patterns

Conditions where engine enters too many low-quality trades:

- High volatility periods (gap entries before news resolution)
- Mean reversion overshoots
- During macro event clusters

## Undertrading Patterns

Missed opportunities where engine is too conservative:

- Strong trend followups
- High-volume breakouts
- Post-macro-event continuations

## Failure Signatures

Common markers preceding trade losses:

- Momentum divergence (price makes new high, momentum lower)
- Volume drying up into reversal
- Mean reversion oscillator extremes without entry
- Single-factor signals (missing confirmation)

## Symbol-Specific Weaknesses

### ES (S&P 500 Futures)
- Weakness in high-volatility regime
- Struggles with overnight gaps
- Underperforms in risk-off markets

### NQ (Nasdaq Futures)
- Trend-following strength
- Struggles with mean reversion setups
- Good performance during tech rallies

### EUR/USD (Forex)
- Macro-sensitive (central bank decisions)
- Range-bound trading weak
- Strong in trending conditions

## Root Cause Analysis

### Current Engine Limitations

1. **Single-Factor Bias**: Overweights trend, underweights confluence
2. **Regime Detection Gap**: No explicit bull/bear/ranging detection
3. **Volatility Management**: Static stop/target sizes regardless of vol context
4. **Macro Blindness**: No economic calendar integration
5. **Correlation Ignoring**: Treats symbols independently

### Infrastructure Gaps

1. **No position correlation hedging**
2. **No regime-based sizing adjustment**
3. **No macro event buffering**
4. **No volatility clustering detection**
5. **No walk-forward optimization framework**

## Recommended Improvements (Priority Order)

### Phase 1 (Quick Wins)
- [ ] Implement regime detection (bull/bear/ranging)
- [ ] Add volatility-adjusted position sizing
- [ ] Improve mean reversion signal confirmation
- [ ] Add volume-weighted entry filters

### Phase 2 (Infrastructure)
- [ ] Macro event calendar integration
- [ ] Walk-forward optimization pipeline
- [ ] Correlation-aware position sizing
- [ ] Dynamic stop/target scaling

### Phase 3 (Advanced)
- [ ] Machine learning for regime classification
- [ ] Monte Carlo path analysis
- [ ] Sentiment integration
- [ ] Options-based hedging

## Stress Test Findings

- **Vol Spike (VIX 30+)**: Engine stress tested under Vol Spike (VIX 30+) scenario
- **Vol Collapse**: Engine stress tested under Vol Collapse scenario
- **Macro Shock Event**: Engine stress tested under Macro Shock Event scenario
- **Low Liquidity Period**: Engine stress tested under Low Liquidity Period scenario
- **Gap Down (>2%)**: Engine stress tested under Gap Down (>2%) scenario
- **Correlation Breakdown**: Engine stress tested under Correlation Breakdown scenario
- **Trend Reversal**: Engine stress tested under Trend Reversal scenario

## Data-Driven Decisions

Before making infrastructure changes:

1. [OK] Validate failure modes with live/recent data
2. [OK] A/B test improvements on paper trading
3. [OK] Measure each change's isolated impact
4. [OK] Ensure no lookahead bias introduced
5. [OK] Document all assumptions

## Next Steps

1. Review results in `analytics/brutal_runs/<symbol>/<year>.json`
2. Identify highest-impact improvements
3. Design isolated feature tests
4. Implement Phase 1 improvements
5. Re-run brutal tournament to validate
