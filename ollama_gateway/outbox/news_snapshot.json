Consumer strength remains in question as we enter the holiday hiring season, which might be playing into delayed or curtailed job creation. These numbers are preliminary and could change as new data is added. The federal government\u2019s delayed September employment report, released last week, showed that the economy added 119,000 jobs that month, better than economists had predicted. But for self-employed workers, the news wasn\u2019t as good. The gig economy lost 114,000 jobs that month. In fact, the ranks of self-employed workers have been declining all year. As of September, U.S. gig employment was down 1.2 percent from a year ago. A new ADP Research report suggests that structural demographic change is on track to reverse this short-term downward trend. We believe that self-employment is poised to become an important share of job gains over time. The latest ADP NER Pulse data points to a concerning shift in the U.S. labor market, with private payrolls dropping by 13,500 jobs per week for the four-week period ending November 8, 2025. This marks a significant acceleration from the prior period, where only 2,500 jobs were\u2026Private payroll losses accelerated in the past four weeks, ADP reports The U.S. labor market is showing further signs of weakening as the pace of layoffs has picked up over the past four weeks, payrolls processing firm ADP reported Tuesday. Private companies lost an average of 13,500 jobs a week over the past four weeks, ADP said as part of a running update it has been providing. That\u2019s an acceleration from the 2,500 jobs a week lost in the last update a week ago. With the government shutdown still impacting data releases, alternative data like ADP\u2019s has been filling in the blanks on the economic picture. Government agencies such as the Bureaus of Labor Statistics and Economic Analysis have released revised schedules, but critical reports such as the monthly nonfarm payrolls count won\u2019t come out until December. * **Details** Specs ----- ###### Source: ###### Measures: Estimated average weekly change in the number of employed people during the previous 4 weeks, excluding the farming industry and government; ###### Usual Effect: 'Actual' greater than 'Forecast' is good for currency; ###### Frequency: Released weekly, on the first Tuesday about 2 weeks after the rolling four-week period ends; ###### Derived Via: ADP analyzes payroll data from more than 26 million workers to derive employment growth estimations; ###### Also Called: NER Pulse; ###### Acro Expand: Automatic Data Processing, Inc.

Export demand also impacts production and prices at domestic manufacturers; Trade in goods makes up about 75% of total trade, and therefore provides early insight into the Trade Balance data reported about 5 days later. A positive number indicates that more goods were exported than imported.
